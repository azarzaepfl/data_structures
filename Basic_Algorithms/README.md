This section explores the implementation of some fundamental sort algorithms. The most basic being sorting algorithms.

## Sorting Algorithms

### Insertion Sort

An efficient algorithm for sorting a small number of elements. It works the way many people sort a hand of playing cards. We start with and empty left hand and the cards face down on the table. We then remove one card at a time from the table and insert it into the correct position in the left hand.
